            Video games are a billion-dollar business and have been for many years.<br>
             In 2020, the revenue from the worldwide PC gaming market was estimated <br> 
             almost 37 billion U.S.dollars , while the mobile gaming market generated <br> 
             an estimated income of over 77 billion U.S. dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Video games have been around for decades, providing entertainment for children and adults alike. <br>
            They have evolved significantly from the early days of computer games and the first versions of Nintendo and Atari. <br>
            The days of pixelated screens and limited sounds are a distant memory as video games have become more lifelike <br>
            than ever. As technology continues to improve, so do video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            Video game creation has become increasingly complex, and the cost of creating a game to run on one of the major <br>
            consoles has risen with this greater complexity. It was once unthinkable to sink millions into development costs, <br>
            but games today can cost tens and even hundreds of millions. This has pushed game development into Hollywood movie <br>
            territory in terms of production and marketing costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's no surprise that companies want a piece of the pie. In 2020, the gaming industry generated $155 billion in revenue, <br>
            By 2025, analysts predict the industry will generate more than $260 billion in revenue.1 As such, tech companies are <br>
            looking to get involved in this revenue stream. Tech giants such as Google (GOOGL), Meta (FB), formerly Facebook, <br>
            and Apple (AAPL), have all made plans to enter the video game industry.
